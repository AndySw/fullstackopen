Hello friend and greetings from sunny England!

Although I didn't have to, I did create example HTML & CSS for exercises 1 to 4 as per the MDN tutorial.

For exercises four to six, I have used Visual Paradigm Community Edition to generate Sequence diagrams to satisfy the course requirements.

Please note that the base "Page Load" functionality is modelled separately and then referenced in other diagrams where appropriate to save repetition.

Please ignore the contents of "part1" for the time being, I got a little ahead of myself.

Thank you for your time and attention in reviewing my submission, and I look forward to any feedback you may have.

Andy Sweetman
