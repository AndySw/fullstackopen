Dear reviewer, greetings from sunny England!

For excercise 4, I have used Visual Paradigm Community Edition to generate Sequence diagrams to satisfy the course requirements here.

Please note that the base "Page Load" functionality is represented in the file "exampleapp - Page Load.pdf" and that this is referenced in the file "exampleapp - New Note.pdf"

Thank you for your time and attention reviewing my submission.
